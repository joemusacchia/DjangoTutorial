## Django tutorial

With an interest in full-stack web development, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) seems to have become extremely popular.  To expand my skill set, I am following [the Django tutorial project on the official documentation page](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/).  As I learn how the MVC is created inside the Django web framework, I will attempt to add a single page experience with React.js.  This README will also be updated along with my progress.
